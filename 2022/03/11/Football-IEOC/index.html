        <p>In this semester, I took part in the Football Champions League of High School Affiliated to Nanjing Normal University and I held the post of the captain of IB United Team. I had learnt a lot from becoming a member of the football club in our school and had developed tacit understanding with my teammates, so I could lead this team with high proficiency. For instance, it did not take my much time to select players for our team because I knew who could perform better and who was suitable to be a super-substitute and I also communicated and discussed with some core members to determine what would be the starting line-up. The most impressive thing to me was what the senior students from upper class have taught me about how to be a real captain. Our team did not perform well in both of the two matches, we lost the first round in a big score of 0-3 and was defeated by the opponent in penalty kick. Every players in the team was depressed and disappointed and so was I, however, the seniors told me that I could not be defeated although everyone fell down and it was my responsibility to encourage and comfort my teammates. At that time, I realized that a captain is not just a person who wears the captain’s armband and plays well himself in a match, but should take responsibility to defend the honor of a team, to lift teammates from the upset feeling and to motivate the team to perform better.</p>
<p>I entered for one of the Economics competitions called International Economics Olympics last year with my other three classmates and have accomplished the first round in this competition this semester and I won the individual first prize and our team won the team first prize. I think it is not hard for me to win the prize because I had put in the efforts for Economics in the previous semester and had understood all the knowledge that needed to be grasped by the attenders, however, I still felt exhausted physically and emotionally during the preparation of the competition because my teammates could not figure out those knowledge and questions easily and I needed to give them classes not only for a good result but also for the responsibility of being the leader of this team. Actually, they cooperated with me at the beginning and them did have the will to do well at the competition. However, as the training time became longer and the the training volume increased, they lost there passion for the competition gradually. Finally, they straightly and definitely ignore my efforts and messages, so I stopped to help them and gave up my wish to this team. Although the result was not bad and they did understand how urgent and important the competition was after I told them I would not help them any more, the process and preparation of the competition cannot be regarded as successful. I admit that I did not encourage them when they slacked and I gave up what a leader should do in the second-half period of the preparation, that is what I need to reflect and pay attention to for the next time.</p>
